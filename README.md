# Command Chain

**Command Chain** is a browserâ€‘based coding game for people looking to learn to code or just have some fun and test there skills! CommandChain spits out a box on a convayor belt and it is your task to use JavaScript styled code to decide how to complete your assigned mission with the code, missions include sorting boxes by weight, color, etc. Boxes are fully random so you must use advanced functions and if statements to determine how to orgamize your Factory!

```js
player.move("right");
player.grabBox();
if (player.box.color === "red") {
  player.sendBox("right");
  player.setStopper(40);
}
```

# Roadmap / Task List
